## Where can I get help?

Come on over to the pellcorp discord server, the `#simple-af-microprobe` channel has been setup for anyone wanting support for microprobe.

[![invite](assets/images/invite.png '#simple-af-microprobe')](https://discord.gg/2uGDzyJ3WX)

## Firmware requirements

This guide assumes you have a K1, K1C, K1SE or K1 Max and you are running stock creality firmware 1.3.3.5 or higher, or alternately you are using  [my prerooted firmware](https://github.com/pellcorp/creality/wiki/Prerooted-K1-Firmware).   Any other pre-rooted firmware is explicitly not supported and the installer.sh will validate this and refuse to proceed if you try to use it on different firmware.

## Slicer Settings

There is an assumption that you are using a slicer like OrcaSlicer and Machine G-code like:

![image](assets/images/slicer.png)

**Machine start G-code**
```
M140 S0
M104 S0
START_PRINT EXTRUDER_TEMP=[nozzle_temperature_initial_layer] BED_TEMP=[bed_temperature_initial_layer_single]
```

**Machine end G-code**
```
END_PRINT
```

### Custom Bed Mesh Profile

If you want to select a specific predefined bed mesh profile (which disables adaptive mesh generation), you can pass in an additional `START_PRINT` parameter:

You can either hard code it to a particular model, like `BED_MESH_PROFILE=myprofile` or you can specify a profile based on orca slicer variables, such as `BED_MESH_PROFILE="[curr_bed_type] - [filament_type]"`, but you have to make sure you have all the possible profiles
defined for each of the bed type and filament type combinations.

## Probe Installation

### Mount Options

| Mount           | URL                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Default**     | <https://www.printables.com/model/867527-k1-biqu-microprobe-mount-remix>                                                  |
| **BootyGantry** | <https://github.com/tlace17/K1-Linear-Rail-Gantry/blob/main/STLs/Probe%20Mounts/Rail%20Carriage%20Microprobe%20Mount.stl> |

**Important:** All mount options assume a V2 microprobe is being used, after the installation you may need to modify `microprobe.cfg` to 
switch the pin config:

```
#pin: ^nozzle_mcu: PA9  # MicroProbe V1 users should use this line to trigger on high
pin: ^!nozzle_mcu: PA9  # MicroProbe V2 users should use this line to trigger on low
```

### Wiring

The probe and the TOUCH port on the Nozzle MCU board both mate with a 5-pin Molex Picoblade connector. A 5-pin cable is needed to connect the probe to the TOUCH port.

Some sellers may call the connector "Micro JST SH 1.25" but that is [incorrect](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/m6mibq/comment/gr6w1m0). Several premade cables are compatible. Most notably the Creality cable for their CR Touch probe:

- <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BKPFY24M/>

Connect to TOUCH port on the nozzle MCU. it is accessible from the side left (LIDAR) side of the printhead and only the external cover of the printhead has to be removed.

## Installation

The installation can only be performed on a printer which has been rooted and ssh granted

You need root access, if you are not already root, then follow the excellent [Helper Script Enable Root Access](https://guilouz.github.io/Creality-Helper-Script-Wiki/firmwares/install-and-update-rooted-firmware-k1/#enable-root-access) instructions.

### Factory Reset 

If you have installed helper script or fluidd or mainsail from Creality, you must do a factory reset before running the installer.sh!

```
wget --no-check-certificate  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pellcorp/creality/main/k1/services/S58factoryreset
chmod +x S58factoryreset
./S58factoryreset reset
```

!!! warn

    It is really important you do not close the ssh session until you get this message:

    ![image](assets/images/factory_reset.png)

### Clone the Repo

```
git config --global http.sslVerify false
git clone https://github.com/pellcorp/creality.git /usr/data/pellcorp
sync
```

??? note "RPC Timeouts, try SSH Git Clone"
    ```
    mkdir -p /root/.ssh
    wget --no-check-certificate "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pellcorp/creality/main/k1/ssh/git-ssh.sh" -O /root/git-ssh.sh
    chmod 777 /root/git-ssh.sh
    wget --no-check-certificate "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pellcorp/creality/main/k1/ssh/pellcorp-identity" -O /root/.ssh/pellcorp-identity
    export GIT_SSH_IDENTITY=pellcorp
    export GIT_SSH=/root/git-ssh.sh
    git clone git@github.com:pellcorp/creality.git /usr/data/pellcorp
    cd /usr/data/pellcorp && git remote set-url origin https://github.com/pellcorp/creality.git && cd
    ```

### Config Overrides

If you have pellcorp-overrides in github but not stored locally, [you need to recreate the /usr/data/pellcorp-overrides directory](config_overrides.md#create-local-repo) before running the installer.sh!

### Run the installer

To run the script, you must specify the probe you want to use.

```
/usr/data/pellcorp/k1/installer.sh --install microprobe --mount Mount
```

!!! warning

    For `Mount` you must specify the mount option for the mount you have used, if you do not do this the printer will be incorrectly configured for your mount, and bed meshes, x and y limits and related config will be wrong.   Please refer to [Mount Options](#mount-options) for supported mounts.   

    If you are using a non-supported mount you should specify a mount option as close to your mount as possible and properly adjust your configuration after installation before trying to perform a bed mesh or Screws Tilt Calculate!

??? note "RPC failed; curl 18 transfer closed"

    You might get this error:
    
    ```
    error: RPC failed; curl 18 transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining
    fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
    fatal: early EOF
    fatal: index-pack failed
    ```
    
    Just rerun the installer.sh script (with the same probe argument), it will start from the stage that failed (most of the time this
    will be the Installing Klipper stage!)
    
    You can also prefix the installer command with `AF_GIT_CLONE=ssh` to force git to clone via ssh, this will take a **lot** longer, but it will never time out, so its good in a pinch if you are getting repeated klipper repo clone failures.

## Post Installation

### V1 Probe Changes

The default microprobe.cfg assumes a V2 microprobe a post install change to `[probe]` section of `printer.cfg` will be required for a V1.  Have a look at the printer.cfg after the install has finished and have a look at the commented V1 pin config.

### MCU Firmware updates are pending

At the end of the installer process if you get this message:

```
WARNING: MCU Firmware updates are pending you need to power cycle your printer!
```

It means that new MCU firmware updates need to be applied and this can only be done by power cycling the printer.  After your printer is power cycled you can verify firmware was updated with the `CHECK_FIRMWARE` macro from Fluidd or Mainsail, if you see this message:

```
INFO: Your MCU Firmware is up to date!
```

Your printer MCU firmware was updated successfully.   If you still see the `MCU Firmware updates are pending you need to power cycle your printer!` message after a power cycle, check the `/tmp/mcu_update.log`, you may be asked to provide this file on Discord if you need additional assistance, sometimes an additional power cycle can solve the problem, there is a very short window of time (15 seconds) in which the MCU firmware can be updated, so  there is a chance it will work after an additional power cycle.

### Verify USB Key

It is important to make sure you have a way to [emergency factory reset](misc.md#emergency-factory-reset) the printer, if the worst happens.   There is a macro in Simple AF called `CHECK_USB_KEY` that will wait for you to plug a USB thumb drive (aka USB key) in and tell you if it was able to be successfully mounted.

![image](assets/images/check_usb_key.png)

- If you get the message: `INFO - USB Key was recognised and mounted correctly (/tmp/udisk/sda1)`, your USB thumb drive (aka USB key) is perfect to use for a factory reset.
- If you get no message at all before the script ends (after 60 seconds), your USB thumb drive (aka USB key) is defective.   You can check the `messages` file in the logs section of your UI to get more details about why the usb key could not be mounted!

!!! tip

    You should verify your USB thumb drive (aka USB key) often just to make sure you have something if you need to unbrick your printer, simply type `CHECK_USB_KEY` or hit the button in Fluidd / Mainsail
    The USB key should be FAT32 formatted and be no larger than 32GB!

### Calibration

For the microprobe it is **extremely** important to do the PROBE_CALIBRATE step to configure your z-offset, regardless of what model you have used to mount the probe!

![image](assets/images/probe_calibrate.png)

You should use the [Paper Test Method](https://www.klipper3d.org/Bed_Level.html#the-paper-test) for this z-offset calibration.

!!! note

    The default z-offset for Microprobe is 0, so your prints won't stick without doing this step.

### First Print

For this first print you can go and do the tuning first (PID Tuning, etc) or you can go ahead and optimise your probe z offset using baby stepping.

In fluidd the save button after you finish or cancel your print can be a bit hard to find, look for

![image](assets/images/fluidd_save_zoffset.png)

### Timer too close and microsteps

For microprobe you cannot use more than `microsteps: 64`

### Tuning

At least PID tuning (bed and extruder) and input shaping is required for acceptable printing.  If you try and print after running the installer.sh and a power cycle but before any calibration you will most likely have horrendous quality, the worst you have ever seen on the k1.   After PID tuning and input shaping you should see the same kind of quality as you get with stock k1 + input shaper fix.

#### Quick Start

You can use the QUICK_START Macro to do Bed and Nozzle PID Tuning and Input Shaping.

#### Pid Tuning

**Source:** [Calibrate Pid Settings](https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html?h=pid#calibrate-pid-settings)

For example you might run these:

```
PID_CALIBRATE_BED BED_TEMP=65
PID_CALIBRATE_HOTEND HOTEND_TEMP=230
```

!!! note

    The `PID_CALIBRATE_BED` and `PID_CALIBRATE_HOTEND` macros are located in the `useful_macros.cfg` file and they have defaults values for BED_TEMP and HOTEND_TEMP so you can just run them by clicking on them if you want that same temperature.

#### Input Shaping

There is no default configuration for input shaping so it is essentially disabled out of the box.

You can use the `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` macro to run input shaping, just be sure to `SAVE CONFIG` at the end, to choose the automatically selected shaper config, be aware though that the shaper chosen might be sub-optimal due to a slight difference in vibrations between two options.  So you should probably review the output and potentially choose an alternative if it gives you higher recommended max acceleration for minimal increase in vibration.

[Input Shaper Auto Calibration](https://www.klipper3d.org/Measuring_Resonances.html#input-shaper-auto-calibration)

### Probing speed

On a K1/Max a faster lift_speed may counter the backlash on the Z-axis belts. Going too fast is likely making the bed bounce back in the opposite direction. Find the best speeds for probing by varying the probe_speed and lift_speed parameters. BIQU Microprobe is an optical probe and as a rule slow probe_speed will give better results. Start with probe_speed=1 and vary the lift_speed values to find the optimal lift_speed first.

```
PROBE_ACCURACY probe_speed=1 lift_speed=15
```

In this case, lift_speed of 15mm/s seems optimal.

![image](assets/images/probe_accuracy_15mm.jpg)

After determining the optimal lift_speed, different probe_speed values can be tested until the sweet spot is found. Here 1.0mm/s works most reliably, however, the slow speed will make the meshing process take longer.
