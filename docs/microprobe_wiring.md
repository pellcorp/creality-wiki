# Wiring

!!! note

    This wiring section applies to K1/K1C/K1SE/K1M printers only

The probe and the TOUCH port on the Nozzle MCU board both mate with a 5-pin Molex Picoblade connector. A 5-pin cable is needed to connect the probe to the TOUCH port.

Some sellers may call the connector "Micro JST SH 1.25" but that is [incorrect](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/m6mibq/comment/gr6w1m0). Several premade cables are compatible. Most notably the Creality cable for their CR Touch probe:

Connect to TOUCH port on the nozzle MCU. it is accessible from the side left (LIDAR) side of the printhead and only the external cover of the printhead has to be removed.
