# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I use Simple AF with my default probe / Load Cells?

The short answer to this question is no. But if you would like to know why, continue reading.
The code required to use the Creality Load Cells for probing is proprietary and has been refused for sharing with the community by Creality. There have been some attempts by the community to get this working, but those attempts arenâ€™t currently complete. Some of these, while 'working,' require further hardware modifications to the Load Cell control board. Modifications that most users wishing to stick with Load Cells would prefer not to make, as these modifications would no longer allow a user to return to stock firmware.

This feature may come eventually, but SimpleAF currently does not support the use of the default load cells.
If you have successfully incorporated the use of Load Cells into SimpleAF or Klipper and would like to contribute, please let us know.

## How do I integrate a Nozzle Wipe?

So Simple AF will likely never integrate nozzle macros directly nto the base product as most mounts and probes have no options for nozzle wipes or they only work with changes to slicer settings and faulty regions in bed meshes which I just don't want to deal with,
however a couple of community members have contributed solutions you can use.

!!! danger

    Do not use a nozzle wiper with a rear mounted probe, there is a strong likelihood of destroying the probe or damaging the printer

### Purcell Nozzle Wipe

You can find the advanced_nozzle_cleaner.cfg file at <https://www.printables.com/model/1023575-advanced-nozzle-wiper-for-creality-k1-series>,
and upload it to your config directory

Make sure its included **after** `[include start_end.cfg]` in `printer.cfg`
    
Then make these changes to `advanced_nozzle_cleaner.cfg`:

Disable this:

```
#[gcode_macro CX_NOZZLE_CLEAR]
#rename_existing: _CX_NOZZLE_CLEAR
#gcode:
#  WIPE_NOZZLE
```

Add this:

```
[gcode_macro _SAF_NOZZLE_WIPE]
gcode:
WIPE_NOZZLE
```

**I provide no guarantees this works because I have only tested it allows klipper to start, but this is how you integrate the nozzle cleaner, its up to you to verify your mount does not collide with it.**


### Calin Nozzle Wipe

For Calin solution its all on the website:

## How do I switch from btteddy to eddyng?

If you have calibrated the btt eddy, you can switch to the eddyng, but you will have to manually remove any btt eddy specific configuration from the SAVE CONFIG section of your printer.cfg file.

To make sure Simple AF repo is up to date and on the right branch, run this:

```
~/pellcorp/installer.sh --branch main
```

Then to switch to eddyng from eddy while retaining most of your customisations:

```
~/pellcorp/installer.sh --update eddyng --mount TheMount
```

!!! warning

    Note you will need to change the `TheMount` to the eddy-ng mount you are using [eddy-ng mount options](eddyng#mount-options)

    Klipper may fail to start because of the btt eddy configuration at the bottom of the file, you can just manually clean those up, save and restart.


## How do I switch from btteddy to cartotouch?

If you have calibrated the btt eddy, you can switch to the cartotouch, but you will have to manually remove any btt eddy specific configuration from the SAVE CONFIG section of your printer.cfg file.

To make sure Simple AF repo is up to date and on the right branch, run this:

```
~/pellcorp/installer.sh --branch main
```

Then to switch to cartotouch from btteddy while retaining most of your customisations:

```
~/pellcorp/installer.sh --update cartotouch --mount TheMount
```

!!! warning
    Note you will need to change the `TheMount` to the cartographer mount you are using [cartographer mount options](cartographer#mount-options)

    Klipper may fail to start because of the btt eddy configuration at the bottom of the file, you can just manually clean those up, save and restart.


## How do I add my own macros to Simple AF?

So you cannot modify or add new macros to Simple AF cfg files, they will be erased the next time you update, what you should do instead is add your own .cfg files with your macros.

So create a new file in the config directory, if you create the file in the config directory, Simple AF will back it up for you to the pellcorp-overrides directory where it can be automatically added to your github and will survive a factory reset.

So first step is create a new file in the config directory via fluidd or mainsail, I am going to call my file `example.cfg`

Then just add `[include example.cfg]` to `printer.cfg`, just put it at the end of all the existing includes, save and restart and your macro should appear in the list of macro buttons.

!!! note

    Its worth noting cfg in sub-directories will not be automatically backed up so best to keep them all in the main config directory.


## Why can't I use force move?
    
We disable FORCE_MOVE by default because it works on the stepper level so for multi-z users it would create havoc, and also force move does not work so well for moving x and y either, so its really not that useful.
SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION is a much better choice as once you activate this you can use the normal movement buttons in fluidd and mainsail.

So if you need to move your nozzle up from being on the bed you should run:

```
SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION Z=0
```

This tells the printer to pretend that the nozzle is at zero, so this allows you to move the bed down the the max height of z

If you want move to your bed up to the nozzle you should instead do something like:

```    
SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION Z=200
```

The reason why you cannot choose Z=0 for this scenario is you are telling the printer its at 0 z and the min position for z is -5, so this would only allow you to move the bed down 5mm, so you need to fake the printer into setting the bed to sufficient height to allow you to move it down sufficiently.

If you were to set `SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION Z=100`, but your bed is already at the bottom of the printer there is no way to bring the bed up to meet the nozzle because it will exceed minimum position after moving 105mm.

If you wish to restore access to force move set the `variable_disable_force_move: True` to False in `sensorless.cfg` and save and restart.

## How do I replace Simple AF the Kamp Line_Purge with a custom line purge?

So currently there is no official support to do a simple line purge like stock creality, but it is possible with a trick to replace the Simple AF `Line_Purge.cfg` macro with your own.

First step is to disable `[include Line_Purge.cfg]` in `printer.cfg`

Second step is to create a new macros file, call it something like `CustomMacros.cfg` (it matters not what its called, just as long as it is not the name of an existing file), and create your own `LINE_PURGE` macro.

Third step is to add a new include to `printer.cfg` for your new custom config file, and your `LINE_PURGE` macro will be called now instead of the KAMP one.

The reason this is recommended over just commenting out `LINE_PURGE` in `start_end.cfg` and adding your own macro call, is everything I have described above will survive an Update and even a factory reset because config overrides supports removing the `Line_Purge.cfg` include, adding a new include to `printer.cfg` and backing up your custom files. 


## How do I integrate Knomi?

[Knomi Support](custom_hooks.md#knomi-support)


## How can I change MCU fan from always on?

By default Simple AF configures the main MCU fan to always be on to avoid overheating the MCU, you can instead restore it to only come on when the steppers or heaters are activated by a few tweaks to fan_control.cfg.

So disable this:

```    
[static_digital_output mcu_fan_always_on]
pins:PB2
```

Enable this:

```    
[controller_fan mcu]
pin: PB2
tachometer_pin: ^PC6
heater: extruder, heater_bed
stepper: stepper_x, stepper_y, stepper_z
idle_timeout: 90
```

You also have the option of making the MCU fan purely temp based, however there is a risk if the temp sensor on the MCU is a bit dodgy the fan might not startup early enough to avoid damage or weird behaviour from the MCU and other components, I strongly recommend leaving the MCU fan to always be on

But if you want to, something like this might work:

So disable this:

```
[static_digital_output mcu_fan_always_on]
pins:PB2
```

And add this config:

```    
# thanks to Habitural from discord
[temperature_fan _mcu_fan]
pin: PB2
kick_start_time: 0.8
off_below: 0.1
#max_power 1.0
sensor_type: temperature_mcu
control: pid
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 80
pid_kp: 1.0
pid_ki: 0.5
pid_kd: 2.0
min_speed: 0.1
max_speed: 0.8
target_temp: 38
```

You may need to add `ADC_TEMPERATURE` to the `[duplicate_pin_override]` section if using this last option.

Note config overrides should retain these config changes as long as you do them in the fan_control.cfg file (special handling for that file allows adding and removing whole sections)


## How do I get the printer to lower the bed at the end of a print?

This is just a configuration change to the `start_end.cfg` `_CLIENT_VARIABLE` `variable_custom_park_dz` value, you change the value from 25.0 to 50.0 or whatever you want.   If you print a really tall print the bed will be lowered as much room as there is left without exceeding the stepper_z max_position.


## How do I switch default UI from fluidd to mainsail and back?
    
To switch to mainsail:

```
~/pellcorp/tools/switch-default-ui.sh mainsail
```

To switch back to fluidd:

```
~/pellcorp/tools/switch-default-ui.sh fluidd
```

This change will survive updating Simple AF, but will not be retained for a reinstall or a factory reset. 

!!! note

    If you run the above and receive an error like:

        ```
        root@K1Max-AF34 /root [#] ~/pellcorp/tools/switch-default-ui.sh mainsail
        -sh: /root/pellcorp/tools/switch-default-ui.sh: not found
        ```

    It means you are on an older version of Simple AF and you should instead use the old style commands:

        ```
        /usr/data/pellcorp/k1/installer.sh --branch main
        ~/pellcorp/tools/switch-default-ui.sh mainsail
        ```


## How do I change the hostname?

You can update the /etc/hostname with the new hostname from ssh like this:

```    
echo "myhostname" > /etc/hostname
sync
```

Next time you power cycle your printer, the hostname should be updated


## How to install Happy Hare on Simple AF?

!!! note    

    This does not apply to Simple AF for RPi

The default installer needs to be executed with some different arguments

So first of all clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/moggieuk/Happy-Hare.git /usr/data/Happy-Hare
```

Then run the installer:

```
cd /usr/data/Happy-Hare
./install.sh -k /usr/data/klipper -c /usr/data/printer_data/config -z -m /usr/data/moonraker
systemctl restart moonraker
systemctl restart klipper
```


## How do I enable moonraker timelapses?

[Enable Moonraker Timelapse](misc.md#moonraker-timelapse)


## Where can I find stock configuration files?

So Guilouz who created Helper Script hosts the latest version of the K1 / K1M / K1C firmware on his website, you can find the stock config files in his repo:
<https://github.com/Guilouz/Creality-K1-Extracted-Firmwares/tree/main/Firmware/usr/share/klipper/config>

I am also starting to collect some squashfs (decrypted) for various firmware as well at <https://github.com/pellcorp/downloads/tree/main/creality/firmware>

## How can I test a new Simple AF feature?

So pellcorp or someone else has ask you to test a feature and you forgot how.   So each proposed feature is going to be in its own branch.   To switch branches or to get new updates for that branch:

```    
~/pellcorp/installer.sh --branch jp_some_feature
```

Then you need to run an update:

```    
~/pellcorp/installer.sh --update
```

Pellcorp will tell you the branch name, so replace jp_some_feature, with the branch he gave you!


## How do I control octoeverywhere?
    
[Installing Octoeverywhere Companion](misc.md#octoeverywhere-companion) 

Octoeverywhere Companion is controlled by systemd, and each printer is a separate service, so you can see them here:

```
$ systemctl list-units octo* --all
UNIT                               LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION                 
octoeverywhere-companion-2.service loaded active running OctoEverywhere For Moonraker
octoeverywhere-companion.service   loaded active running OctoEverywhere For Moonraker
```

To check status:

```
systemctl status octoeverywhere-companion.service
```

To start it:

```    
sudo systemctl start octoeverywhere-companion.service
```

To make it start on boot:

```    
sudo systemctl enable octoeverywhere-companion.service
```

The configuration for each instance of the service is in a separate directory in your home directory, so in my case I have two of them:

```
~/.octoeverywhere-companion/
~/.octoeverywhere-companion-2/
```

And you can find a octoeverywhere.conf in each directory and you can change the IP address in that config file and restart the service:

```
sudo systemctl restart octoeverywhere-companion
```


## How to read belt shaper graphs?

Take a look at this video recommended by @EAZY
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfnWsBOt3_8>


## How can I make sure my bed is level / trammed?

ZeroDotCmd created a great video on the subject of teeth skipping with a few options for how to do it
<https://youtu.be/S2d_9Ysz-Q8>

Note this is not about bed mesh, this video is just about getting your bed level enough for bed mesh to be effective.


## How to enable Github backups for my configuration?

[Backup Config Overrides](config_overrides.md#git-backups-for-configuration-overrides)

## How can I set a chamber fan target temp from my slicer?

So currently there is no way to pass in a parameter to start print for this, but there is a really easy workaround and you can even set the target per filament.   The target being the temp at which the fan gets activated.

So per filament in Orca Slicer find the **Print chamber temperature** and set a value in celcius, but do **NOT** check the **Activate temperature control** checkbox.

Then in your Machine start Gcode above START_PRINT add this line (before the START_PRINT line):

```
M141 S{chamber_temperature[0]}
```

The M141 macro provided by Simple AF (derived from Helper Script) sets the target of the chamber fan via this macro.

![image](assets/images/print_chamber_temp.png)


## How do I cleanup all those backup printer config files?

!!! note

    This does not apply to Simple AF for RPi

Simple AF runs a cleanup every time the printer starts it does the following:

- Deletes all log files older than 7 days (excluding moonraker.log, klippy.log and guppyscreen.log), if all log files are older than 7 days, it will leave the the newest old file intact
- Deletes all backup tar.gz files older than 7 days, if all backup .tar.gz files are older than 7 days, it will leave the newest intact
- If there is less than 1GB of space left on /usr/data it will remove all gcode files older than 7 days

You can also run this script manually via the hidden macro _CLEANUP_FILES

## What is bed warp stabilisation and why is it good?

An excellent video from need it make if for why heat soaking is absolutely vital for optimal bed mesh
<https://youtu.be/8PEsPLDxt-c>

In Simple AF out of the box when you start a print a period of bed warp stabilisation is performed.   The default macro will wait 8 seconds for every degree of target bed temp.

This is also often referred to as heat soak and it allows the heated bed to settle into its final state before performing the bed mesh.

You can disable it before a print by toggling the bed warp stabilisation toggle, which you can find in the fans and outputs section of your UI.

In Fluidd its here:

![image](assets/images/bed_warp_stabilisation_toggle.png)

In Mainsail its here: 

![image](assets/images/mainsail_bed_warp_stabilisation_toggle.png)

You can disable it permanently by changing the `start_end.cfg` `[output_pin Bed_Warp_Stabilisation]` value to **0**.

You can also modify the following configuration in `_START_END_PARAMS`:

- `variable_bed_warp_wait_multiplier`  - So this value is how many seconds per degree of final bed target temp.
- `variable_bed_warp_fraction_wait` - If the bed temp is at least 75% of target we will do partial heat soak, if it's less than 75% will heat soak then entire target amount.
- `variable_bed_warp_wait_interval` - This is how long the macro will sleep between notifications

!!! note

    Please note at the end of a print the heater of the bed will remain heated until the printer times out in a hour.

If you want to use bed warp stabilisation but not keep the heater on at end, you can change the `start_end.cfg` `_START_END_PARAMS` `variable_end_print_keep_bed_heated` to `False`!

For some probes like the eddy (so for `btteddy` or `eddyng`) sitting just above the heated bed for an extended period of time can cause it
to be excessively heated, there is a `start_end.cfg` property `variable_start_print_bed_heating_move_bed_distance` which can be set to something like `100`
to position the toolhead much further away from the bed while the bed heats, the default value of 20mm might not be sufficient for your use case.

## How do I use my cartographer for input shaping?

[Cartographer Input Shaper](cartographer_faq.md#how-do-i-use-my-cartographer-for-input-shaping)

## How can I downgrade from CFS Firmware?

Creality added logic to prevent downgrading to older version of firmware, but its super easy to work around this, we just need to
download an older `local_ota_update.sh file`, I have saved the 1.3.3.46 version of the script to my downloads repo to make it
easier to get.

So first of all go and grab the version of the older K1 firmware you want from <https://www.creality.com/pages/download-k1-flagship>,
save it to a USB key, and stick it into the front of your printer!

Now login via ssh to your printer

From the ssh command line on your printer download the older `local_ota_update.sh` script like so:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Guilouz/Creality-K1-Extracted-Firmwares/refs/heads/main/Firmware/etc/ota_bin/local_ota_update.sh -O - > /usr/data/local_ota_update.sh
chmod 777 /usr/data/local_ota_update.sh
```

Now you can flash new firmware with this script without the version downgrade logic getting in the way:

```
/usr/data/local_ota_update.sh /tmp/udisk/sda1/CR4CU220812S11_ota_img_V1.3.3.46.img
```

You should wait until you see lines like the following especially `ota update ok`:

```
rootfs.squashfs read ok, now quit
ota: data processed: 99% 127696896 132233080
rootfs update done
start update rtos
zero.bin read ok, now quit
ota: data processed: 100% 452408 132233080
rtos update done
ota update ok
256+0 records in
256+0 records out
ota: stoped success
```

Then you can logout of your ssh session and power cycle your printer.   It is a good idea to factory reset your printer just to be sure all remnants of the CFS abomination has been excised!

!!! note 

    If you get the error `-sh: /usr/data/local_ota_update.sh: Permission denied`, you forgot to do
    `chmod 777 /usr/data/local_ota_update.sh`

    If you get the error `/tmp/udisk/sda1/CR4CU220812S11_ota_img_V1.3.3.46.img Not a file` it means
    either you did not download the latest img or else for some reason the usb key was mounted to somewhere
    different than `/tmp/udisk/sda1/`

    You can check which directory the usb was mounted with the following command:

    ```
    mount | grep 'sda'
    ```

    For example for my USB key its not mounted to `/tmp/udisk/sda1`, instead its mounted to `/tmp/udisk/sda`:

    ![image](assets/images/mount_usb_grep_sda.png)

    So I would need to specify instead: 

    ```
    /usr/data/local_ota_update.sh /tmp/udisk/sda/CR4CU220812S11_ota_img_V1.3.3.46.img
    ```

## How can I prevent a print starting or resuming if there is no filament present?

A new feature has just been merged to Simple AF to support this, but you will need a normal filament sensor switch, update
to latest Simple AF and enable a setting after installation.

You need to update to latest Simple AF:

```
~/pellcorp/installer.sh --branch main
~/pellcorp/installer.sh --update
```

!!! note

    If you run the above and receive an error like:

        ```
        root@K1Max-AF34 /root [#] ~/pellcorp/installer.sh --branch main
        -sh: /root/pellcorp/installer.sh: not found
        ```

    It means you are on an older version of Simple AF and you should instead use the old style commands:

        ```
        /usr/data/pellcorp/k1/installer.sh --branch main
        ~/pellcorp/installer.sh --update
        ```

Then open the `start_end.cfg`, find the `variable_runout_sensor` in the `_CLIENT_VARIABLE` section and set it to match
your filament runout sensor, like so:

```
variable_runout_sensor: "filament_switch_sensor filament_sensor"
```

Save and Restart

Then when you try to start a print without filament you will get a message like:

![image](assets/images/print_aborted_no_filament.png)

## How can I switch to a toolhead filament runout sensor?

So if you are using the DXC extruder, Creality CFS Extruder, or even the Henlor Mod for the stock Extruder, you want to switch
from using the runout sensor bolted to the printer case and use the extruder runout sensor on the toolhead, its really easy, its
literally just a single config change in your printer.cfg.

So find the `[filament_switch_sensor filament_sensor]` and change:

From: `switch_pin: !PC15`

To: `switch_pin: !nozzle_mcu:PA10`

It should look something like this (there may be `event_delay` and `pause_delay` which should be left alone):

```
[filament_switch_sensor filament_sensor]
pause_on_runout: false
switch_pin: !nozzle_mcu:PA10
runout_gcode: _ON_FILAMENT_RUNOUT
```

Save and Restart and enjoy!

!!! danger

    Do not define two filament_switch_sensor that both _ON_FILAMENT_RUNOUT for `runout_gcode`, the installer will 
    remove the `[filament_switch_sensor filament_sensor_2]`, do not restore this config!

    Please also note that on more recent versions of Simple AF the `pause_on_runout` value is set to false, because
    we trigger `PAUSE` from the _ON_FILAMENT_RUNOUT macro now to avoid phantom triggers of pause when changing filament!

## What is Axis Twist?

So ZeroDotCmd has done some great videos on this topic <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_U8t5Ap0Ik> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KVTRDim1lk>

More details here: <https://www.klipper3d.org/Axis_Twist_Compensation.html>

## Can I get GrumpyScreen on Helper Script?

So I have added experimental support for installing GrumpyScreen (our fork of GuppyScreen) onto Helper Script printers, currently only
K1, K1C, K1SE and K1M are supported and the support is experimental, I make no guarantees things won't break, so you **must** have already installed GuppyScreen
via helper script and then you can run the following from your printer ssh console:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pellcorp/creality-wiki/refs/heads/main/helperscript/install-grumpyscreen.sh -O - > /usr/data/install-grumpyscreen.sh
sh /usr/data/install-grumpyscreen.sh
```

It will replace guppyscreen binary and configuration file, you can update GrumpyScreen via the screen only, the Helper Script `GUPPY_UPDATE` macro
has been removed as it breaks grumpyscreen.

If you want to revert to normal guppyscreen just uninstall and reinstall from Helper Script, I do not provide a script to do this automatically

Please note that GrumpyScreen is a vastly simplified version of Guppyscreen:

- No Gcode execution
- No Belts & Shake
- No Input Shaper
- No Bed Mesh
- No TMC Metrics
- No Tuning (other than during a print)
- No Limits
- No Power Devices (wtf that is)

We focus on polishing a subset of features and we added some additional ones:

- Factory Reset
- E-Stop on more screens
- Setting chamber temp targets

The Belt Shaper calibration macros from GuppyScreen remain and can be executed from fluidd or mainsail

## How do I get the bed to cooldown after a print finishes?

So by default with Bed Warp stabilisation enabled, the bed will stay warm after a print for up to 1 hour (this can be changed too btw), if you do not want
the bed to stay warm after a print you can either toggle the [bed warp stabililation](#what-is-bed-warp-stabilisation-and-why-is-it-good) toggle in fluidd or mainsail before END_PRINT runs or you can modify the 
`start_end.cfg` `variable_end_print_cool_down` and change it to `False`, so it should then look like:

```
variable_end_print_cool_down: False
```
