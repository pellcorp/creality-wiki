# Spoolman

Spoolman moonraker integration  is not enabled by default.  To enable it there are a few steps, you need to add the following include to printer.cfg:

```
[include spoolman.cfg]
```

And uncomment the `[include spoolman.conf]` in moonraker.conf, you will need to change the `server` url to your spoolman server location.

You will need to restart moonraker **and** klipper after this, you can do that via the fluidd or mainsail services section.
