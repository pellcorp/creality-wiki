## Support ZIP

You will be asked to provide a `support.zip` file in the SimpleAF discord, there are a few ways to do this:

- Run the `SUPPORT_ZIP` macro from Fluidd or Mailsail
- Run the `Create Support ZIP` button from the Tools menu of GrumpyScreen
- Run `~/pellcorp/tools/support.sh` from ssh on the printer.

In all cases the support.zip can be found in the `~/printer_data/config` or the config section of fluidd or mailsail.

You need to somehow download this zip file to your local desktop / laptop so you can then upload it to discord.
