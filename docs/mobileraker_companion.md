# Mobileraker Companion

Mobileraker works as a simple UI for Klipper on the phone. Connect it to an existing moonraker installation and control the printer.

    You must not setup Mobileraker on a K1 series machine (which includes Ender 3 V3 KE, NebulaPad and Ender 5 Max) because
    it will overwhelm the processor and cause serious stability issues.  Instead install the Mobileraker Companion on another device 
    on the same WIFI network as the printer.

    It's probably fine to setup Mobileraker on the same host as Simple AF if using Simple AF for RPi series.
