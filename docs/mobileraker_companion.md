# Mobileraker Companion

You must not setup Mobileraker on a K1 series machine (which includes Ender 3 V3 KE, NebulaPad and Ender 5 Max) because
it will overwhelm the processor and cause serious stability issues.

However you can setup mobileraker companion on a separate device in the same network.

!!! note

    It's probably fine to setup Mobileraker on the same host as Simple AF if using Simple AF for RPi series
