# OctoEverywhere Companion

You must not setup OctoEverywhere on a K1 series machine (which includes Ender 3 V3 KE, NebulaPad and Ender 5 Max) because
it will overwhelm the processor and cause serious stability issues.

OctoEverywhere is a 3D printing community project that enables free remote access, AI print failure detection, notifications, and more. OctoEverywhere cannot be installed onto the K1 when running the Cartographer, beacon or btt eddy, the stress placed on the system by running OctoEverywhere is too great, however the OctoEverywhere Companion running on another device on the same WIFI network as the K1 works great.

!!! note

    It's probably fine to setup Octoeverywhere on the same host as Simple AF if using Simple AF for RPi series
