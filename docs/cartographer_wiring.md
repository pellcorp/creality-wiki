# Wiring

!!! note

    This wiring section applies to K1/K1C/K1SE/K1M printers only

On a K1M you can use the lidar cable either directly by repinning it, or via the pass through lidar port on the toolhead.  However you cannot use the lidar port on the toolhead for K1, K1C or K1SE.   The reason this does not work is because for Lidar on the K1M creality actually routes a completely separate USB cable from the mainboard.
