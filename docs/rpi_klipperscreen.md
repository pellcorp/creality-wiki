# KlipperScreen

To install KlipperScreen on Simple AF for RPi, there is currently an assumption that you are using a BTT DSI or BTT HDMI screen,
other screens might work, but ymmv.

!!! warning

    KlipperScreen might end up disconnecting your network as part of the installation, you might need to power cycle your rpi
    to retain connectivity.

From the printer via ssh, run:

```
~/pellcorp/rpi/install-klipperscreen.sh 
```
