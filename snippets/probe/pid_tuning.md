#### Pid Tuning

**Source:** [Calibrate Pid Settings](https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html?h=pid#calibrate-pid-settings)

For example you might run these:

```
PID_CALIBRATE_BED BED_TEMP=65
PID_CALIBRATE_HOTEND HOTEND_TEMP=230
```

!!! note

    The `PID_CALIBRATE_BED` and `PID_CALIBRATE_HOTEND` macros are located in the `useful_macros.cfg` file and they have defaults values for BED_TEMP and HOTEND_TEMP so you can just run them by clicking on them if you want that same temperature.
